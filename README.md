[UPDATE LOG]:

main.dart is polluted with text data since I couldn't figure out how to use global class objects with flutter. It just became harder with different widgets and my code was showing issues with the declaration of new class objects. I eventually had to resort to hard coding everything to make it work, which seems to work perfectly now. The only downside is that it is 24MB in size, which could be reduced significantly with the removal of the extra hard-coded text. 

I will seek to make the app streamlined in the future, but so far my experience with flutter has been a hit and miss, with a lack of support from the dev community and lack of third party packages that satisfy what one is looking for. I have since then moved onto picking up react, and will be working on a react project soon.
